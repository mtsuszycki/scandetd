Scandeted 1.2.0
 
Scandetd is a daemon which tries to recognize TCP and UDP port scans 
and OS fingerprinting probes. Program also could be used as a TCP/UDP
connection logger.
If it encounters port scan or OS probe  it is able to send an e-mail 
with following informations:
  
  - scanning host  
  - number of connections made
  - port of the first connection and it's time
  - port of the last one and it's time
  - guessed type of scan (SYN, FIN, NULL) - if it was a TCP scan 
  - TCP flags set in packets (if OS probe)

In the configuration file you can specify all necessary options.
Take a look at sample configuration. It should be self explanatory. 
If you want running scandetd to read configuration again then send him
a HUP signal.

Command line arguments:
-v	be verbose - show current configuration at start up.
-s 	do _not_ start the daemon - just show parsed config file.
